## About
Most expense trackers force you to manually type every purchase - time-consuming and easy to forget.
In Bulgaria, every fiscal receipt comes with a **unique QR code** containing the exact time, date and amount.
This app reads these QR codes, and automatically fills the epxense for you - you just need to categorize it. 

Scan your receipts and your spending history will build itself.

## Features
- QR/receipt scanner for instant purchase logging
- Recurring expense scheduling with smart notifications
- Powerful charts (pie, bar, line) for spending insights
- Category/color tagging
- Dark mode
